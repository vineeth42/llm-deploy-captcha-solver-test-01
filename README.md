# My Captcha Solver

## Summary
My Captcha Solver is a simple web application that displays a captcha image from a given URL and allows users to enter the captcha text through an input box. This project demonstrates basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills for handling URL parameters and interacting with the DOM.

## Setup
No special setup is required for this project. Simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. You can also pass a URL to the image as a query parameter using `?url=image_url`.

## Usage
- To display a captcha from a specific URL, open `index.html` and add `?url=your_image_url` to the URL bar. For example: `index.html?url=https://example.com/captcha.png`.
- If no URL is provided, a placeholder image will be displayed by default.
